GENERAL BUGS
============
*


DATA-RELATED BUGS
=================


ADVANCED SEARCH BUGS
====================
these are specific bugs that should be solved by writing a simple failing test case
* First: Change the rules so that field, comparator, and value must be separated by a space; too many bugs caused by optional space - maybe consider trying field + comparator does not require a space, e.g. gtc instead of gt c
* title = search destroy => uses match instead of =
* title matches search and destroy => triggers AND...
* title matches & => blanks and shows all instead of combo cards
* cancels blaster pro => says NOT includes blaster pro
* is clone / is a clone => is includes lone
* type = character => type matches character BUT type eq character => type = character
* Search: Luke's returns nothing, but Lukes does
* Search: commas are broken
* "gtc va" returns nothing
* "pulled by sos" doesn't work, "pulled by c sos" does
* matching and matchingweapon don't work with "for"
* matching/matchingweapon should be disambiguated (matchingstarship, matchingpilot, matchingweapon, matchingcharacterforweapon, matching (all of the above))
* uniqueness doesn't work logically - non-unique, ***, etc. (maybe this is a job for the value class)
* in FilterQuery there is "sketchy" logic (search for that comment.) There should be real logic for this.


FUNCTIONALITY IMPROVEMENTS
==========================
* fuzzy search, which should only fire when there are no results found on a basic search (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-fuzzy-search-in-react-js-using-fuse-js-859f80345657)
* if results include both alias and exact title, list alias last (or sort by score)
* possibly want to include fuzzy search on advanced search values as well...?
* Field might want a true name vs display name that shows in the chip, e.g. "underlyingcardfor" vs "undercard for"


UX IMPROVEMENTS
===============
* acronyms resolve to their expanded selves in the green filter query area (even for basic search)
* Advanced search (for small phones) on press, hide the detailed view of the advanced query and leave just "combined reuslts" showing, on focus on the input field, show again
* on advanced search, if i start scrolling, collapse my advanced search filter queries


DESIGN
======
* iPhone SE (maybe both) should have less padding above navigation tabs
* background on the hint above nav could be transparent, might look better
* empty list state has holocron art - maybe dependent on light vs. dark mode; or maybe just more instructive coach tips
* Sideways starships and weapons show a bit of the green or blue chrome in the list view
* nice designs for bottom bar tabs
* smooth/round the translucent bg on long card titles


REFACTORS
=========
* test coverage
* types for every props object
* turn class components into functional components
* extract the blur footer into a layer on the navbar itself (if that's the final design for the bar)
* build a tokenizer for the advanced search, that takes the first step of taking any string and turning it into a list of tokens
* Rename `FilterQuerySet` to `FilterQueryGroup`
* SearchMode should be a class instead of a couple hashes
* Theme should also probably be a class
* Use Typescript properly in every file...
* `Value` class
 - should contain alias resolver logic
 - values can actually be a set of values, e.g. `gt c numbers` is actually gametext contains either of the two "numbers" cards
 - allow for `lore c foo bar baz` to work with all 3 words
 - this could also allow for "or" logic e.g. `gt c cantina or night club`
 - enums?
 - type checking of sorts? (value is invalid if it doesn't work as a type, like power = bob)
* Repo classes
 - for `Card` and maybe `ExpansionSet`
 - would encapsulate search logic, for various search kinds like case insensitive, etc.
 - would encapsulate the logic for loading the data from the json files
* `FilterQuery` maybe needs a Presenter that can wrap display logic
* every view should actually have a presenter...
* change component architecture of SearchScreen to be more intuitive
* CardPresenter has lots of List view logic, so should be a presenter for that class only
* make presenter for GridView cards as well
* both inherit from a base card presenter class that has common attributes and methods
* cleanup the code in the grid view that was AI generated and kind of messy (eg two stateful variables to track the active/enlarged card)


APP STORE / OPS
===============
* webpage home for app
* migrate this list to a project management tool - Linear?


ONE DAY
=======
* use native driver for CardListItem component e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63976219/style-property-width-is-not-supported-by-native-animated-module-need-advice-f
* Android app
* tablet app
* desktop app
* put all the data behind an API
* Collections
* CV ingestion of cards for decks, and lookups for Search/Rules
